Hom...Jaizen Hom...multi-national man of mystery who wants us to live in more of a mixed world, where various forms of lifestyle including food, fashion, art, music, and entertainment meet for the first time. From nothing to something, adopted as a New York City native, now living again in the City of Angels, Los Angeles, Jaizen has gained expanded knowledge and experience from top professionals, peers, &amp; the most talented teams in their various fields in multiple arenas as a Spokesmodel, SAG Actor, Artist, Host, Curator, Consultant, Brand Ambassador, Casting Director, Producer, Network Owner who&apos;s worked aside Superstars such as Britney, Enrique, Beyonce; he&apos;s a Humanitarian who wants to connect us all.

Also featured on a dozen top industry magazine covers, showcased on countless runway shows globally, and in major in-store, online and catalogs worldwide. Honored to act, Jaizen can be seen in quite a few hit videos, tv, film, and principal commercial spots for household brand names such as Pepsi, Budweiser, Samsung, KIA, etc. Not taking anything too seriously, he views himself as an artist; since childhood, he would sell his graffiti to classmates.
