  WHO? Hom...Jaizen Hom...multi-national man of mystery who wants us to live in
  more of a mixed world, where various forms of lifestyle including food,
  fashion, art, music, and entertainment meet for the first time. From nothing
  to something, adopted as a New York City native, now living again in the City
  of Angels, Los Angeles, Jaizen has gained expanded knowledge and experience
  from top professionals, peers, & the most talented teams in their various
  fields in multiple arenas as a Spokesmodel, SAG Actor, Artist, Host, Curator,
  Consultant, Brand Ambassador, Casting Director, Producer, Network Owner who's
  worked aside Superstars such as Britney, Enrique, Beyonce; he's a Humanitarian
  who wants to connect us all. WHAT? Being blessed to be in great company, for
  two decades heâ€™s been spotlighted as one of the first nominated contract male
  supermodels of the year for famous designers such as Tommy Hilfiger, Jean-Paul
  Gaultier, Hugo Boss, Versace, amongst most others in America and overseas.
  Also featured on a dozen top industry magazine covers, showcased on countless
  runway shows globally, and in major in-store, online and catalogs worldwide.
  Honored to act, Jaizen can be seen in quite a few hit videos, tv, film, and
  principal commercial spots for household brand names such as Pepsi, Budweiser,
  Samsung, KIA, etc. Not taking anything too seriously, he views himself as an
  artist; since childhood, he would sell his graffiti to classmates.
  Flash-forward, Jaizen would have his pieces showcased in museums. After all,
  aren't we all artists to some degree? He would ask himself. An activist on
  numerous subjects; please inquire to know more ; ) WHERE? After touring,
  hosting and coordinating a memorable amount of special events at his exotic
  venues with major sponsors over the years from coast to coast including celeb
  clients Lady Gaga, Diddy, and Pamela Anderson to name a few; much charity work
  has been accomplished. Mr. Hom has slowed down a bit to pick and choose which
  future installments mean the most; especially interested in seeing what ties
  in with his new network theme named THEmPOT. When Jaizen's not on top-secret
  missions, you can find him fishing, or doing other outdoor and indoor
  activities like watching cartoons : ) How can we work together? Please email:
